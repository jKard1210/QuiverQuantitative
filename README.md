To create Random Forest models, run `modelRF_new.py`. You can adjust the `change` and `days` variables in order to create models for different time period and price changes. After you have created your models, run `predict_new.py` to generate current predictions. You must first adjust the `models` list in order to align with the models that you have generated.
